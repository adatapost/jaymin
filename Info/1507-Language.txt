 C# Language 
 =============================================================

 C# is ,
   
    1. CLS Compliant programming language
    2. case-sensitive language
    3. statically strongly-typed language
    4. supports Object Oriented Paradigm
    5. C# compiler/language produces MSIL code from the C# code and save into .dll or .exe assemblies.
    6. has feature of "Dynamic Programming" language 

 1. CLS Compliant means it is designed as per CLS specification   
 2. Statically strongly-typed means each & every data and its type is checked during the compilation. If
    data and its datatype match then C# compiler compiles the code, produce compiler errors otherwise.

      For example,    int n = 10;
                      byte b = n; <--- won't compiled
                      float c = 10.10;  <-- won't compiled 10.10 is consider as "double"
 3. Object Oriented Paradigm is a way to design the code in such manner so every one 
    can benefit from the code. 
         It means the developers can re-use the code in one or more ways. 
         The customers can be benefited by the quality and cost of the product.
         The users of the system/product can easily understood the behavior of the product.

     The most important benefictor of the system is "Developer/Programmer" and the OOP offers number of
     technique to design the source code.

               These techniques are :
                         1. Encapsulation and abstraction
                         2. Inheritance, Generics (or meta programming) and
                         3. Polymorphism

      Different different programming languages support the technical aspect to design the code via
      above mentioned techniques.

      To achieve encapsulation and abstraction in programming code, we must have to use "TYPES" system and
      access control keywords (public, private, protected etc).

      Abstraction? An abstraction draws an outline between the user of the code and the creator of the code. It
                   separates the code definition from its declartion and also its users from the creators.

      Encapsulation is a result of "abstraction". That means we can achieve encapsulation (protect the code, data from
      users) via abstraction.

  4. Dynamic Programming 
 
     The term dynamic is related to the TYPES system. In Dynamic types system, data type is associated with the
     value and not with the variable.
          e.g

               (C# code):

                     dynamic n;
                     n = 10;      // 10 is int
                     n = "Hello"  // "Hello" is string
                     n = 10.10    // 10.10 is double



 
     The Visual Studio - An IDE - Integrated Development Environment
     ================================================================

     We will use Visual Studio IDE to author the .net applications. The VS integrats us with "Compilers", "CTS", 
     "CLR", and many other tools including debugging, testing tools.

     The VS uses "project template" system for different purpose of applications. The project template describes
     the nature of software/application, number of libraries and technologies used by the application, how to
     compile the one or more source code, how to integrat other resource files and so on.

      Project template
      -----------------
      This is the entry point to use the VS.

      This template helps the developer to :

           1. Choose appropriate version of .NET Framework
           2. Choose the programming language to author the code
           3. Select the necessary CTS TYPES (libraries)
           4. Select the way to "build" the application. The "Build" is a name of some activities to 
              compile all source code file and generate a single "assembly".
           5. It define the software "deployment" strategy (software installer)
           6. It allow us to use "components" from one application to another application (i.e one project to
              another project).
            
       In fact, project template is nothing but a project configuration file that is saved as .csproj for C# language
       and .vbproj for VB language.

       So, when you create a project named "HelloApp". The VS's project template creates a "HelloApp" folder and
       inside this folder you will find "HelloApp.csproj" file. This ".csproj" is itself a project template.
